# chat-with-Pdf-using-RAG-Pipeline
Overview

The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to 
interact with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files. The system should extract, chunk, 
embed, and store the data for eFicient retrieval. It will answer user queries and perform 
comparisons accurately, leveraging the selected LLM model for generating responses.

Features
